# Maru3D OTLA
OTLA is a simple python program created for my FNF Psych Lua 3D renderer project.
It basically takes any .obj or .mtl and converts it into a Lua array file.
For animations it also can take folders with OBJ Sequence files.

## Support
* Vertices
* Faces
* Normals
* Texture Coordinates
* Diffuse Colored and Textured Materials
* OBJ Sequences

## How to use
### Converting OBJ files
Select a OBJ file with the "Open OBJ File" button. Then check with the text boxes what you want to be exported to the model.
If your model has textures mark the "Use Materials" checkbox.
### Converting OBJ Sequence files
Select a folder where to take the OBJ files from with the "Open OBJ Sequence Folder" button.
The rest goes the same as with single OBJ files.
### Converting MTL files
Select a MTL file with the "Open MTL File" button. No settings are needed
