# Maru3D OTLA
OTLA is a simple python program created for my FNF Psych Lua 3D renderer project.
It basically takes any .obj or .txt and converts it into a Lua array file.

## Support
* Vertex positions
* Faces vertex

## How to use
Once you have your program installed/compiled and opened click the "Open 3D Model File"
to select your file.
Once the file has loaded click the "Convert To Lua" button and wait for it to convert.
Finally after it is converted a "model.lua" file will be created in the location of your executable.
