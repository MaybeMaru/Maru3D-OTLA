# Maru3D OTLA
OTLA is a simple python program created for my FNF Psych Lua 3D renderer project.
It basically takes any .obj or .txt and converts it into a Lua array file.

## Support
* Vertices
* Faces
* Normals
* Texture Coordinates

## How to use
After installing/compilling the program and opening it click the "Open 3D Model File"
to select your file.
Once the file has loaded click the "Convert To Lua" button and wait for it to convert.
Finally after it is converted a "model.lua" file will be created inside the "export" folder.
