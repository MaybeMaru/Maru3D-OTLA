# Maru3D OTLA
OTLA is a simple python program created for my FNF Psych Lua 3D renderer project.
It basically takes any .obj and .mtl and converts it into a Lua array file.

## Support
* Vertices
* Faces
* Normals
* Texture Coordinates
* Diffuse Colored Materials

## How to use
After installing/compilling the program and opening it select your files to convert using the open buttons.
Once the file has loaded click the Convert button and wait for it to convert, should normally be instant.
Finally after it is converted a "model.lua" and "materials.lua" file will be created inside the "export" folder.
